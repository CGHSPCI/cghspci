      <h4><b>Brain Imaging and Laboratory Testing Capability</b></h4><br><br>
     <h4><b>Scope of Service of Brain Imaging (Computed Tomography Scan)</b></h4>
     <h5>Brain imaging, in particular, computed tomography scan (CT-Scan), is important in supporting 
      the diagnosis of stroke, to determine the type of stroke, and to exclude other diseases that may 
      present with stroke-like signs and symptoms. Early imaging evaluation is essential in 
      determining eligibility of an acute ischemic stroke patient to intravenous thrombolysis.
      <br><br>
      <i>Description</i><br>
      The computed tomography scanner (CT scan) in the hospital is a joint venture between the San 
      Pablo City Diagnostics, Inc. and the Community General Hospital of San Pablo City, Inc. with 
      the former being the majority. Nonetheless, both parties are open to suggestions in order to 
      improve their process in imaging patients with stroke especially those requiring immediate 
      scanning such as those who are candidates for intravenous thrombolysis. 
      <br><br>
      <i>Responsible Person/s</i><br>
      Acute Stroke Team<br>
      Radiology Technician on Duty<br>
      Radiologist
      <br><br>
      <i>Scope of Service</i><br>
      The CT scan machine and radiology technician are available 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. 
      Office hours is 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM but a radiology technician is on-duty beyond office hours 
      with a target response time of within 15 minutes from call.
      <br><br>
      <i>Target Response Time</i><br>
      The target response time from request to when the images are seen is within 25 to 60 minutes. 
      Ideally, the cranial CT scan images must be read by a radiologist, but for the purpose of 
      thrombolysis, the scan may be initially interpreted by the neurologist or members of the AST
      adept in reading cranial CTs.
      <br><br>
      <i>Standards/Practices</i><br>
      Policies, processes and procedures are developed based on needs revealed by patient 
      demographics, advances in the industry, changes in regulations, inspection reports, and 
      deficiencies or inadequacies identified in current processes. Audits and systems checks are in 
      place or are being developed as a means to evaluate and modify current processes. A

      <h4><b>Scope of Service of Laboratory</b></h4><br>
     <h5>Basic laboratory tests such as complete blood count, chemistries, coagulation studies, and 
      cardiac markers, as well as ECG and chest radiograph (when necessary) are essential in 
      diagnosing metabolic and infectious disorders that can masquerade a stroke syndrome, in 
      determining other causes of stroke, and in deciding on proper acute medications.
      <br><br>
      <i>Description</i><br>
      The Laboratory Department provides a wide array of testing and other services to patients of 
      Community General Hospital of San Pablo City, Inc., and to other patients and organizations in 
      support of the hospitals mission, operating objectives, and strategic priorities.

      <br><br>
      <i>Scope of Service</i><br>
      The Laboratory Department provide stat and routine clinical laboratory services essential for 
      thrombolysis such as complete blood count, random blood sugar, creatinine, alanine 
      transaminase, troponin I, prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, international normalized 
      ratio, among others.
      <br><br>
      <i>Target Time Goals</i><br>
      The usual turn-around time of routine clinical laboratory requests are within 1.5 to 2 hours. 
      However, for STAT requests such as those for intravenous thrombolysis, the turn-around time 
      may be shortened to within 45 to 60 minutes. Meeting the target time to complete the basic 
      laboratory tests and ancillaries within 45 minutes of them being ordered are still a work in 
      progress.
      <br><br>
      <i>Standards/Practices</i><br>
      Policies, processes and procedures are developed based on needs revealed by patient 
      demographics, advances in the industry, changes in regulations, inspection reports, and 
      deficiencies or inadequacies identified in current processes. Audits and systems checks are in 
      place or are being developed as a means to evaluate and modify current processes. A 
      standardized process is in place for implementation of new policies and procedures.

      <h4><b> Capacity to Perform Thrombolysis</b></h4><br>
     <h5>One of the thrusts of having an ASRH is to improve outcomes in acute ischemic stroke patients 
      by doing intravenous thrombolysis to eligible patients. Time windows as suggested by the 
      National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke are followed.
      <br><br>
      <i>Description</i><br>
      As mentioned in the preceding articles, the Community General Hospital of San Pablo City, Inc. 
      already fulfills the first two (2) key elements required: the Acute Stroke Team, and the Brain 
      Imaging and Laboratory Testing Capability.
      <br><br>
      In addition to the above, our hospital has at least two (2) vials of alteplase which are always 
      available and are replaced as soon as feasible to maintain the availability of two (2) vials at any 
      given time.
      <br><br>
      Though our Stroke Education Plan, members of the Acute Stroke Team and the emergency 
      care providers are updated in the administration of IV rTPA. Critical Care and Stroke nurses are 
      likewise updated in the post-thrombolysis care and monitoring of patients.

      <i>Standards/Practices</i><br>
      The Acute Stroke Team aims to consistently achieve a target time window as suggested by the 
      National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

      An ASRH must be able to deliver initial treatment to acute stroke patients who are seen at the
